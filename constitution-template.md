## ARTICLE I. NAME OF ORGANIZATION

Article I must contain the full name of the student organization and any acronym(s) it is or will be affiliated with. This name must not duplicate the name of any other currently registered student organization.

The name of the organization should:

- Reflect the nature and activities of the organization
- Formally reference any national organization affiliation, abbreviations and/or acronyms

> [!NOTE]

> - Student organizations are separate entities from the University; therefore, student organizations prohibited from referring to themselves as being part of the University.
> - Thus, student organizations may NOT use “The Ohio State University”, “Ohio State”, or “OSU” in the name of their organization. The use of “Buckeye” or “Buckeyes” requires additional approval.
> - However, student organizations may reference their location by indicating “[Name of Organization] at The Ohio State University” or “[Name of Organization] at Ohio State”.

## ARTICLE II. PURPOSE STATEMENT

The purpose of the organization must be clearly stated. Typically, a purpose statement includes both the goals and the functions of the student organization. The organization purpose should be tied to the educational purpose of the University and support the mission of Ohio State.

Additional stipulations regarding active membership (e.g. attendance requirements, etc.) should be addressed in a separate document (your bylaws).

Social Fraternities and Sororities recognized by the Office of Sorority and Fraternity Life may limit membership based on sex.

We always advise organizations consult with the organization’s advisor when removing a member.

Each registered student organization must have at least one advisor who is a member of the faculty or administrative and professional staff selected by the student organization in accordance with its constitution and bylaws.

Classified civil service employees, graduate administrative associates, and emeritus and retired faculty/staff may serve as co-advisors, but the primary faculty/staff advisor is responsible for the certification process. The student organization advisor shall serve as a resource person providing advisory support to officers and members and may not vote or hold office in the organization.

## ARTICLE VI. ADVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES AND SELECTION

ARTICLE VI should include the following information regarding an organization's advisor:

Registered student organizations are required to have a minimum of a Primary Leader, Secondary Leader, and Treasurer officers. Primary Leader and Treasurer must be enrolled as full-time students; Secondary Leader(s) must be student(s) in good standing.

### Section B. Criteria for Officer Eligibility & Selection

#### Subsection 1. Officer Eligibility

However, a student organization formed to foster or affirm the sincerely held religious beliefs of its members may adopt eligibility criteria for its Student Officers that are consistent with those beliefs.

If officers are elected, we recommend including the following:

## ARTICLE VIII. DISSOLUTION OF ORGANIZATION

This article lists the requirements and procedures for the dissolution of the student organization, including the method for distributing any organizational assets and payment of any organizational debts remaining at dissolution. Student organizations that are funded by University funds (e.g. Student Activity fees or by a University unit) and/or have assets purchased with University funds must return those funds/assets to the funding University unit (e.g. Student Government, or sponsoring University department/office) after dissolution in accordance with University policies and procedures.

Describe what happens if, at the time of proposed dissolution, any organization assets and/or debts exist, the appropriate means for disposing of these assets and/or debts.

> [!WARNING]

> Under no circumstances may an organization leave debts to the Ohio State University or its entities.

## ARTICLE IX. BYLAWS FOR [Name of Student Organization]

[Name of Organization] may elect to maintain separate bylaws to outline the day-to-day operations of the organization and to clarify policies and procedures otherwise not included in the previous articles. Bylaws and/or other guiding documents may not take precedence over the requirements set forth by local, state, and federal laws, the Ohio State University’s regulations, policies, and procedures, and the Council on Student Affairs Registration Guidelines for Student Organizations at Ohio State. Amendments and changes may be made to the bylaws and shall be consistent with the Office of Student Life approved constitution on file and the Office of Student Life’s constitution requirements. Should the organization transition leadership in between registration cycles, the articles set forth in this document will remain in place unless a new constitution is provided to the Office of Student Life and is approved.

Most student organizations benefit from creating a separate document to outline additional organizational procedures, called bylaws, instead of incorporating them into their constitution. Any articles the organization wishes to describe that are not included in this document should be maintained in a separate bylaws document. By incorporating bylaws into your constitution, any bylaw changes must be uploaded to the Student Organization Management System and approved by Student Activities staff, which can affect your active status. A student organization’s bylaws and/or other guiding documents may not take precedence over the requirements sent forth by local, state and federal laws, as well as Ohio State University regulations, policies, and procedures, and its Office of Student Activities approved constitution. Bylaws must be produced should it be required by university staff.

We recommend that organizations include the above statement in their constitution which assures your organization’s right to maintain your own bylaws without Student Activities approval as long as they meet the above qualifications.

ARTICLE X: AMENDMENTS TO CONSTITUTION

This article describes how constitutions can be amended and should be the final article in the constitution.

The article must include:

- Process or steps for amending the organization’s constitution
- Who can propose amendments or changes to the constitution
- Necessary vote to approve the change(s) (Ex: 50% majority, 2/3 majority, etc.)

All amended constitutions must be submitted to the Ohio Union and Student Activities for review and approval.
