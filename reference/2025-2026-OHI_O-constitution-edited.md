### Section B. Composition of Membership

In order to fully comply with Ohio State's Guidelines for Student Organizations, the
organization's voting membership is limited to currently enrolled Ohio State students.

Additionally, 90% of the membership of the organization must include current Ohio State University students. Active members and Executive Committee are able to make decisions regarding the membership of community and other non-student members of an organization.

All members are free to leave and disassociate without fear of retribution, retaliation, or harassment.

To fully constitute joining the organization, members must join one or more of the organization's standing committees: Sponsorship, Sustainability, Webteam, Marketing and Communications, Mentorship, Judging, Registration, HackOHI/O Planning, MakeOHI/O Planning, High School I/O planning, and ShowOHI/O planning.

The standing committees should be flexible in name, responsibilities, and membership size to meet the needs of the organization and as such, a majority vote of the Executive Board members present at any Executive Board meeting will approve the addition or removal of a committee.

Further, the four event planning committees will have sub-committees as needed that members may join as well. Sub-committees may be formed or dissolved as the team needs by the leader of the committee.

### Section C. Member Removal

If an organization member engages in behavior that is detrimental to advancing the purpose of this organization, violates the organization's constitution or bylaws, or violates the Code of Student Conduct, university policy, or federal, state or local law, the organization member may be removed through a majority vote of the executive officers in consultation with the organization's advisor.

Community or other non-student members may be temporarily suspended with a majority vote of the Executive Committee.

In the event that the reason for member removal is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) or cannot otherwise be shared with members (e.g., while an investigation is pending), the executive board, in consultation with the organization's advisor, may vote to temporarily suspend a member or executive officer.

## ARTICLE V. STUDENT ORGANIZATION ADVISOR

## ARTICLE VI. ADVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES AND SELECTION

Appointment or nomination of an individual to an executive board position within the organization shall be in general limited to two full consecutive terms in the same position. This recommendation is intended to encourage the continuing infusion of new volunteers into the organization and to encourage office holders to give thought to planning for their successor.

Appointment or nomination to a third or subsequent consecutive term should be limited to situations where such appointment or nomination is believed to be in the best interests of the Association (as determined by the organization's faculty advisor).

### Section C. Removing Officers & Vacancies

Any executive officer of the organization may be removed from their position for cause. Cause for removal includes, but is not limited to: violation of the constitution or bylaws, failure to perform duties, or any behavior that is detrimental to advancing the purpose of this organization, including violations of the Student Code of Conduct, university policy, or federal, state, or local laws. 

The Executive Board may act for removal upon a 2/3 affirmative vote of the executive board in consultation with the organization's advisor. Removed officers or members may appeal the decision within 7 days by submitting a written appeal to the organization's advisor, who will review the case and issue a final decision.

## ARTICLE VIII. DISSOLUTION OF ORGANIZATION

In the event of dissolution, all assets and funds remaining after paying or making provision for payment of all debts and liabilities of the organization shall be returned to the sponsoring university department or office. If the organization is not sponsored by a university department or office, remaining assets and funds shall be distributed to another registered student organization with similar purpose, or to the Ohio State University.

## ARTICLE IX. BYLAWS FOR OHI/O

The organization shall hold at least 4 events per calendar year: HackOHI/O, MakeOHI/O, High School I/O, and ShowOHI/O, with the goal of adding additional events and activities as the organization evolves.

To add a new event or activity of the organization, there should be a majority vote of the executive board or approval from the organization's director to do so. 

To remove an event or activity of the organization (except for HackOHI/O, MakeOHI/O, High School I/O, and ShowOHI/O), the organization's director must approve its removal.

To remove any of the four original events of the organization (HackOHI/O, MakeOHI/O, High School I/O, and ShowOHI/O), there must be both approval from the organization's director and a majority vote of the executive board.

Executive board meetings of the organization should be held no less frequently than monthly while school is in session.

At the first executive board meeting of the school year, a majority vote of the executive board will determine the meeting frequency of executive board meetings.

At any time, a majority vote of executive board members present at a meeting may suspend or postpone a following meeting if it is deemed not necessary.

Meeting frequency of all committees will be determined by each committee's lead with the organization's director's approval.

In addition, meeting frequency of all subcommittees of a committee will be determined by the subcommittee's lead with the committee lead's approval.

## ARTICLE X. AMENDMENTS TO CONSTITUTION

Any proposed amendments to the constitution should be presented to the organization at an executive board meeting and should not be acted upon when initially introduced.

Upon initial introduction, the proposed amendments should be read in the meeting, allowed time for discussion, and then voted upon at the next executive board meeting.

As an exception, if 2/3 of the executive board members vote to move forward with the amendment, voting does not need to wait until the next executive board meeting. If 2/3 agreement is not reached or 2/3 of the executive board members are not present, voting will take place in the next executive board meeting.
